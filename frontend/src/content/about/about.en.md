title: "ABOUT ME"
description: "Who I am, what I do, and where to find me."
intro: |
  Hi, I’m Ren Zhiyan — still learning and still shaping my way of life.
  For me, coding and research are not only about efficiency, but about staying human-centered: connecting technology with people, and turning ideas into something meaningful.  

  I may not be the strongest coder, but I learn fast, adapt quickly, and enjoy building bridges — between research and practice, across disciplines, and among people. 
  I like creating small, playful projects, and I believe there’s always something to learn from others. Think of this site as both a space for experiments and a place where you might meet a friend.
