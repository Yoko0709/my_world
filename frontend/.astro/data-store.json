I joined BetaNYC for 8 weeks during Summer 2022 as a Civic Innovation Fellow.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  ![A low-angle shot of the Manhattan Municipal\r\n  Building.](./manhattan-municipal-building.jpg)\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **BetaNYC operates out of the Manhattan Municipal Building at 1 Centre\r\n    Street.** Technologists work alongside urban planners and other city\r\n    professionals.

These borders, although invisible, affect your life in important ways. Who collects your trash? Who represents you? Who arrives to care for you if you're injured? To answer these questions, it helps to know exactly where boundaries begin and end—and how they overlap.\r\n\r\nBetaNYC maintains an open source web app called [NYC Boundaries Map](https://boundaries.beta.nyc/). First launched in 2018, the Boundaries Map allows anyone to view and explore overlapping jurisdictional boundaries within the city. The map is commonly used by city council staff and community boards in order to direct feedback from constituents to the correct department.\r\n\r\nThe Boundaries Map helps answer questions like, \"which school districts does this community board serve?\", \"which sanitation district do I contact about the trash at 2nd Avenue and East 14th Street?\", and \"what police precinct am I in right now?\"\r\n\r\nThe map was not pleasant to use.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  ![The NYC Boundaries Map as of June 2022.](./boundaries-map-initial.png)\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **The original Boundaries Map.** 13 separate boundaries render with 13\r\n    separate border colors and labels. A rainbow spaghetti of geographic data.\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nWorking together with [Zhi](https://github.com/zhik), we noted several usability issues:\r\n\r\n1. Toggling on more than two districts quickly made the map illegible.\r\n2. Boundaries on the map itself were not interactive.\r\n3. The map's implementation in [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) resulted in rasterized borders and labels, which looked blurry on HiDPI screens.\r\n4. Viewing overlaps required a complex sequence of \"querying\" boundaries by selecting an administrative region and then selecting which district to intersect with, and the query itself was slow to execute.\r\n5. The map required frequent manual zooming and panning, since it did not adapt automatically to queries.\r\n6. Searching for an address required pre-selecting a borough.\r\n7. Viewing additional metadata about a district required leaving the app and searching Google.\r\n8. The app was desktop-only.\r\n9. Visual design polish was generally lacking.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there was no frontend framework in use (!) and I felt there was an opportunity to modernize and speed up development by adding one.\r\n\r\n## Research and Build\r\n\r\nWith a solid list of usability tickets to address, I got to work sketching ideas for how we might fit things together.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  ![A sketchbook containing several small ideas for maps and\r\n  dropdowns.](./sketchbook.png)\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **Sketching ideas.** I explored how we might combine location search,\r\n    district browsing, and overlap browsing within a single interface.\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nWithout delay, we dove into code. After quick exploration with various frontend libraries, I installed [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), which would allow us to build more advanced functionality more easily. We moved from Leaflet to [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) since it offered us exciting opportunities to interact with the map directly.\r\n\r\nWe scheduled video calls with some frequent users of the Boundaries Map in order to better understand how they were using the tool and what could be improved. We shared our work-in-progress prototype for feedback. The participants were excited to be a part of the process and helped validate assumptions we had made.\r\n\r\n## Outcomes\r\n\r\nAfter a few short weeks, we announced the updated app.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"video-wrapper\">\r\n    \u003Cvideo\r\n      autoplay\r\n      loop\r\n      muted\r\n      playsinline\r\n      preload=\"none\"\r\n      poster=\"/video/boundaries-map-poster.png\"\r\n    >\r\n      \u003Csource src=\"/video/boundaries-map.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\r\n    \u003C/video>\r\n  \u003C/div>\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **The new Boundaries Map.** The updated app features overlaps on hover,\r\n    direct interaction with the map, a unified navigation bar, and clearer\r\n    information hierarchy.\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nThe new map automatically zooms and pans to the selected boundary. It displays boundary overlaps on hover, allows single-click filtering by clicking any boundary, and supports mobile viewing. It links to the relevant webpage for a district when available, so users can find things like phone numbers for city council members. And it now allows users to share URLs for filtered views, and export overlap data to JSON for analysis in other tools.\r\n\r\n[Read the announcement](https://beta.nyc/2022/09/07/summer-associates-wrap-up/) or [explore boundaries](https://boundaries.beta.nyc/?).\r\n\r\n## Reflections\r\n\r\nI had never worked with mapping technology before, so it was fun to learn about how to wield geospatial data using Mapbox. (Huge thanks to [Zhi](https://github.com/zhik) sharing his knowledge of GeoJSON and Shapefiles!) Svelte and Tailwind were also new frameworks for me, and this project helped me get more familiar with their capabilities.\r\n\r\nWith extra time, I'd explore how to improve mobile navigation, since touchscreens can't support the same hover interactions as desktop. I'd also explore whether it's worth introducing color to the base map to more clearly communicate the locations of parks, water, and other regions. (Boundaries Map is [open source](https://github.com/BetaNYC/nyc-boundaries), so maybe I'll get to these one day! Or maybe you, my reader, can make contributions of your own.)\r\n\r\nBetaNYC introduced me to the city's vast library of [open data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/), and I've continued to think about other possibilities for design and technology to surface public data for good.","src/content/posts/boundaries-map/index.mdx",[451],"./boundaries-map-og.png","bd6f5410848cda9b",true,"commonplace",{"id":454,"data":456,"body":465,"filePath":466,"assetImports":467,"digest":470,"deferredRender":453},{"title":457,"description":458,"datePublished":459,"dateModified":460,"img":461,"ogImage":464},"Building Commonplace","What goes into building a design system for healthcare?",["Date","2024-01-13T05:13:17.000Z"],["Date","2024-05-20T07:29:20.000Z"],{"src":462,"alt":463},"__ASTRO_IMAGE_./commonplace.png","A collection of Commonplace components represented in Figma and in code.","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./commonplace-og.png","import BeforeAfter from \"../../../components/BeforeAfter.astro\";\r\nimport actionPlanBefore from \"./action-plan-before.png\";\r\nimport actionPlanAfter from \"./action-plan-after.png\";\r\nimport memberTableBefore from \"./member-table-before.png\";\r\nimport memberTableAfter from \"./member-table-after.png\";\r\nimport ProjectInfo from \"../../../components/ProjectInfo.astro\";\r\n\r\nimport neves from \"./neves.jpeg\";\r\nimport minji from \"./minji.jpeg\";\r\nimport amber from \"./amber.jpeg\";\r\nimport taylor from \"./taylor.jpeg\";\r\nimport liza from \"./liza.jpeg\";\r\nimport owen from \"./owen.jpeg\";\r\nimport brennan from \"./brennan.jpeg\";\r\nimport craig from \"./craig.jpeg\";\r\nimport aster from \"./aster.png\";\r\n\r\n\u003CProjectInfo\r\n  collaborators={[\r\n    {\r\n      name: \"Neves Rodrigues\",\r\n      url: \"https://www.nevesrodrigues.com/\",\r\n      img: neves,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: \"Minji Lee\",\r\n      url: \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/minji-lee-ba045518/\",\r\n      img: minji,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: \"Amber Greene\",\r\n      url: \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amberhamptongreene/\",\r\n      img: amber,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: \"Taylor Maynard\",\r\n      url: \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylorjmaynard/\",\r\n      img: taylor,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: \"Liza Fryberger\",\r\n      url: \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/liza-fryberger/\",\r\n      img: liza,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: \"Owen Tran\",\r\n      url: \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/owentran27/\",\r\n      img: owen,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: \"Brennan Moore\",\r\n      url: \"https://www.zamiang.com/\",\r\n      img: brennan,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: \"Craig Spaeth\",\r\n      url: \"http://www.craigspaeth.com/\",\r\n      img: craig,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: \"Aster Ryan\",\r\n      url: \"https://aster.fyi/\",\r\n      img: aster,\r\n    },\r\n  ]}\r\n  timeline={{\r\n    start: \"March 2019\",\r\n    end: \"July 2021\",\r\n  }}\r\n  tech={[\"Figma\", \"React\", \"React Spring\", \"Storybook\", \"TypeScript\"]}\r\n  roles={[\"Strategy\", \"Research\", \"Product Design\", \"Engineering\"]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n[Cityblock](https://www.cityblock.com/) is a health company which got its start within Google's [Sidewalk Labs](https://www.sidewalklabs.com/).

I joined Cityblock in February 2019 as a Product Designer and recognized a need for a more systematic approach to design. Over the following two years, I built and expanded a design system in Figma and React. I named it **Commonplace**.\r\n\r\n## The Challenge\r\n\r\nCityblock was less than two years old, but Commons already offered a sprawling set of features, including: tracking member status, charting member acuity, coordinating member outreach, storing and editing core demographics, viewing health history, scheduling events, managing tasks for individuals and teams, creating and administering health assessments with automated scoring, texting members... all that, and more planned.\r\n\r\nAll of these features converged in an interface that looked like this:\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  ![The Cityblock dashboard. There are many different styles, colors, and\r\n  fonts.](./initial.png)(quality:100)\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **The appearance of Commons when I joined Cityblock.** Here, in the\r\n    right-hand drawer, a user is composing a progress note about the current\r\n    member. The varying colors, typography, and hierarchy make the interface\r\n    difficult to understand. All member data displayed in this case study is\r\n    notional.\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nAlthough there were some underlying commonalities and shared language throughout the product, **the design was not scaling to meet the needs of its users or developers.**\r\n\r\nA lack of systemization was leading to longer development times, more time spent on undifferentiated work, more bugs in the product, and a user experience that was inconsistent and confusing. These problems would only worsen as Cityblock grew.\r\n\r\n## Mapping the Territory\r\n\r\nTogether with Cityblock's Director of Design, [Neves](https://www.nevesrodrigues.com/), we catalogued the available views. I conducted a product audit, clicking through and taking screenshots of every view, dialog, drawer, and dropdown within Commons. The images were then organized into folders for future reference.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"video-wrapper\">\r\n    \u003Cvideo\r\n      autoplay\r\n      loop\r\n      muted\r\n      playsinline\r\n      preload=\"none\"\r\n      poster=\"/video/product-audit-poster.png\"\r\n    >\r\n      \u003Csource src=\"/video/product-audit.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\r\n    \u003C/video>\r\n  \u003C/div>\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **A product audit.** We captured screenshots from every corner of Commons\r\n    and organized them in folders corresponding to the app's information\r\n    architecture.\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nThe product audit helped us understand the current state of Commons, and it ushered in an essential archival practice for the future. Throughout my tenure at Cityblock, I would continue to catalogue product interfaces at least once a year.\r\n\r\nFollowing the product audit, we created an [interface inventory](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/interface-inventory/), collecting all variations and permutations of each component and displaying a collage of those permutations on a large poster board.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  ![A black foam board with several sheets of paper pinned to it. Each sheet of\r\n  paper displays a component name and a collection of variations on that\r\n  component observed in the product.](./inventory.png)\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **The interface inventory.** The product audit screenshots were used to\r\n    create a collage of each component's variations. How many header styles can\r\n    you count?\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nThis inventory allowed us to more easily spot inconsistencies and discuss how best to resolve them across the system.\r\n\r\n## Laying Foundations\r\n\r\nOnce the interface inventory was complete, we focused on design foundations—typography, color, and spacing. All components rest on top of these three primitives, and we wanted to get the essentials right.\r\n\r\n### Typography\r\n\r\nCare teams at Cityblock are given small Chromebooks to take with them around the city. They use their Chromebooks to access Commons in many locations: the office, at community hubs, in members' homes, and in their car or on the subway.\r\n\r\nAs we laid out a typographic scale and compared different typefaces, we made sure to test text on the Chromebook's low-DPI display in a variety of real-world, less-than-ideal lighting conditions, in order to ensure that Commons was legible in every setting.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  ![A screen within Commons](./low-contrast-typography.png)(quality:100)\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **Low-contrast typography within Commons.** Many views contained small,\r\n    light text which was difficult to read under ideal conditions, and\r\n    practically impossible in others. All data is notional.\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nWith Cityblock's brand designer, [Minji](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minji-lee-ba045518/), we tested various typefaces for the product before landing on [Graphik](https://commercialtype.com/catalog/graphik) for its legibility and understated friendliness. All text colors within the new design system would adhere to [WCAG AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum) or [AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced) contrast ratios.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  ![The Commonplace typographic scale, using the font,\r\n  Graphik.](./typography.png)(quality:100)\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **The typographic scale.** The base unit is set to 16 pixels and most header\r\n    sizes scale up from there using\r\n    [`rem`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#ems_and_rems).\r\n    After experimentation, we decided to break this scale for the body size (15\r\n    pixels) and small text (13 pixels) in order to maintain medium-high data\r\n    density.\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\n### Color\r\n\r\nWhen considering colors in Commons, we prioritized pure function, accessibility and contrast, relation to the brand, and coherence as a whole.\r\n\r\nI also examined the use of color in film to portray two separate settings—the hospital and the home.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"two-up\">\r\n    ![A collage of various hospital settings portrayed in film and\r\n    TV.](./hospital-palette.png)(quality:100)\r\n\r\n    ![A collage of various \"home\" settings portrayed in film and TV.](./home-palette.png)(quality:100)\r\n\r\n  \u003C/div>\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **Colors of the hospital, and colors of home.** What feelings do these scenes evoke?\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nThe hospital blue-greens are distinctly clinical, down to the robes worn by patients and doctors, and feel somber and sterile. “Home” tones, in contrast, emit a warm, welcoming glow. I wrote at the time, \"Cityblock should feel less like the hospital, and more like home.\"\r\n\r\nThis led to guiding principles:\r\n\r\n> **Guiding Principles for Color in Commons**\r\n>\r\n> 1. **Color gently.** Opt for soft, subdued tones. Avoid highly-saturated, electric colors.\r\n> 2. **Use high contrast elements sparingly.** What is the one action on any given view that deserves attention?\r\n> 3. **Skew warm.** Do not tint neutrals blue.\r\n\r\nAnd the resulting palette, defined as matching Figma styles and CSS variables:\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  ![The Commonplace color palette with matching variables in\r\n  CSS.](./colors.png)(quality:100)\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **The color palette.** Colors are arranged along a spectrum from 100 (light)\r\n    to 900 (dark). Some colors are aliased with a semantic name, so developers\r\n    don't need to remember that icons are `--color-neutral-600`. They can just\r\n    use `--color-icon`.\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\n### Spacing\r\n\r\nWe agreed to use an 8 pixel grid for all components, and we agreed on specific fixed widths for sidebars while leaving the rest of the app responsive to scale with the browser.\r\n\r\n## Building Components\r\n\r\nOnce foundations were in place, primitives were set up both in Figma and as CSS Variables in the codebase, and we were able to quickly and easily replace all existing hex codes with new color variables, replace existing padding, margin, widths, and heights with the new spacing scale, and swap out the typography.\r\n\r\nThen began the long and steady process of building and replacing components one-by-one. Create a new `Button`. Test it. Swap out all existing buttons and delete all existing styles. Merge in the changes. Pick a new component, rinse and repeat.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  ![Components displayed in Figma and in code.](./components.png)(quality:100)\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **Commonplace components.** Each component in the codebase included unit\r\n    tests, a Storybook story, and [JSDoc\r\n    comments](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started) for each prop in order to\r\n    provide in-context documentation within VS Code.\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nComponent work took place over the course of many months, alongside other feature work I was involved in. It took place largely independently, although I continued to collaborate with [Neves](https://www.nevesrodrigues.com/) for visual and interaction design feedback, researchers like [Amber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amberhamptongreene/) and [Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylorjmaynard/) for user insights, and engineers like [Brennan](https://www.zamiang.com/), [Aster](https://aster.fyi/), and [Craig](http://www.craigspaeth.com/) for code review.\r\n\r\nWe chose an incremental approach—rather than building and shipping an entirely new design system all at once—in order to maintain forward momentum, bug test along the way, and enable new features to be built with new components as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n## Outcomes\r\n\r\nBy January 2020, most views within Commons used Commonplace components. **Responses from engineers and care team members were overwhelmingly positive.** Bug reports decreased, new features became easier to build, and engineers got to spend more time on differentiated work and less time fiddling with CSS.\r\n\r\nDespite the addition of new components, several thousand lines of code had been deleted since the start of the project due to the reusability and modular nature of the design system—a meaningful reduction in complexity and technical debt.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  \u003CBeforeAfter\r\n    before={{\r\n      src: actionPlanBefore,\r\n      alt: \"The action plan in Commons before the introduction of Commonplace.\",\r\n    }}\r\n    after={{\r\n      src: actionPlanAfter,\r\n      alt: \"The action plan in Commons after the introduction of Commonplace.\",\r\n    }}\r\n  />\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **Member action plan, before (early 2019) and after (early 2020).** More\r\n    information is available at a glance, without drilling down into cards and\r\n    accordions.\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  \u003CBeforeAfter\r\n    before={{\r\n      src: memberTableBefore,\r\n      alt: \"The member table in Commons before the introduction of Commonplace.\",\r\n    }}\r\n    after={{\r\n      src: memberTableAfter,\r\n      alt: \"The member table in Commons after the introduction of Commonplace.\",\r\n    }}\r\n  />\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **Member table, before (early 2019) and after (early 2020).** We aimed to\r\n    main medium-high data density, helpful for our care staff, while making the\r\n    UI feel more approachable and calm.\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nAround this time, I gave a company-wide talk about design systems, a concept which was unfamiliar to many people outside of the tech team. There was palpable excitement over seeing the drastic comparisons of before and after screens.\r\n\r\nI would continue to contribute design and code toward Commonplace until my departure in July 2021.\r\n\r\n## Reflections\r\n\r\nCare teams at Cityblock do difficult, meaningful work, and it's essential that the technology we build for them respects their time and energy. I'm proud of the way I was able to help transform Cityblock's approach to design and engineering, and (hopefully) reduce stress for our hard-working care teams.\r\n\r\nHealth tech is a complex space, and I still see dozens of ways that Commons could be streamlined. A design system is only as strong as the features it's used to build, but where a design system ends and product features begin isn't always clear. There is always more to do.\r\n\r\nAs I write this, in February 2024, **I've just [returned to Cityblock](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/evadecker_its-been-awhile-but-im-excited-to-be-back-activity-7166518870042730496-bUhd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) to help level up design systems again.** After 3 years' absence, the system foundations I put in place have held up well. Some areas have flourished, others have remained the same, and a few weeds have sprouted, but it's a wonderful feeling to see the work you put so much effort into continue to endure.","src/content/posts/commonplace/index.mdx",[468,469],"./commonplace.png","./commonplace-og.png","1dfee4c0f0bd94ea","design-outside-the-computer",{"id":471,"data":473,"body":497,"filePath":498,"assetImports":499,"digest":501,"deferredRender":453},{"title":474,"description":475,"datePublished":476,"dateModified":477,"img":478,"ogImage":479,"features":481},"Design outside the computer","Your digital UI can come from the physical world.",["Date","2024-05-20T17:30:34.000Z"],["Date","2024-05-28T16:18:08.000Z"],{"src":479,"alt":480},"__ASTRO_IMAGE_./guestbook-cover.png","A collection of hand-drawn postcards.

It's an old-school kind of webpage—something I've always wanted to create, but never really had the tools for until now.\r\n\r\nIt's a [guestbook](/guestbook).\r\n\r\nIn the guestbook, anyone can write and publish a short message accompanying a name and optional URL. Once submitted, the message gets published to the top of the page for everyone to see. That's it—no likes, no shares, no threads.

It's about how invigorating it can be to design digital UI when you step away from your computer.\r\n\r\nI didn't want to build just any plain stream of messages and text—I wanted to create something that felt warm, personable, and tactile—like signing a real book. To accomplish that, I first did something important: I shut my laptop.\r\n\r\n## The death of texture\r\n\r\nThe world around us is full of texture. From the bark of an elm tree to the weave of a linen blanket... even the body of a MacBook isn't completely smooth. Most digital spaces, in contrast, are textureless. Flat expanses of nothingness, stretching into a grainless void.\r\n\r\nOur interfaces used to be more textured. During the heydey of [skeuomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph#Virtual_examples) in the late 2000s, designers prided themselves on being able to craft realistic-looking wood grain, leather, glass, and other effects.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Apple released iOS 7, featuring a redesigned user interface which, under Jony Ive, fully embraced flat design, bringing a swift death to the iPhone's skeuomorphism. The vast majority of digital spaces soon followed suit.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure class=\"no-bleed\">\r\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"two-up\">\r\n    ![The home screen of iOS 6.](./ios6.png)\r\n\r\n    ![The home screen of iOS 7.](./ios7.png)\r\n\r\n  \u003C/div>\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **iOS 6 (left) and iOS 7 (right).** iOS 7's flat design effectively killed skeuomorphic design trends across the industry.

So much of the web today feels boring, samey, and soulless.\r\n\r\n## Real-life objects can live on your website\r\n\r\nLet's push that pendulum back the other direction! A bit, at least. Let's give the web some soul. Let's give it some **texture**.\r\n\r\nHow do you add texture? You could browse for Photoshop packs and fiddle with layers and blend modes to emulate real life. Or, you could grab some paper, scissors, and markers, and go craft in your living room on a nice Spring day.\r\n\r\nThe second option is way more fun.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure class=\"no-bleed\">\r\n\r\n![Two stamps sit beside small rectangular piece of cream-color card stock. There is a red stamp on the paper with a hand holding a match alight.](./notecard-progress.png)\r\n\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **Crafting cards.** Stamps from [Casey Rubber Stamps](https://www.caseyrubberstamps.com/) in NYC.\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nI spent an afternoon cutting out same-sized rectangles of card stock and doodling on them with whatever drawing tools I had around. Highlighters, pencil, crayons. Washi tape. Some ORAL stickers I stole from the queer health clinic. Every card is a little bit different.\r\n\r\nI scanned in the cards using a flatbed scanner, cleaned up the images in Photoshop, and optimized them for web. Now all these physical objects have a digital home. :)\r\n\r\n## Tips for bringing physical media into digital UI\r\n\r\nWorking with physical media is rewarding. Quirks of the medium show up in ways that would require large effort to reproduce digitally—the edges I cut are not quite straight; the lines I drew are not perfectly even. Sometimes the ink smudged. It's okay! Desirable, even.\r\n\r\nBut translating media into digital space takes care to show up and perform well. Here are a few tips if you're thinking of bringing real-life objects into your digital designs.\r\n\r\n### Know how your layout will flow and reflow\r\n\r\nBefore starting, ask yourself: will text need to wrap to multiple lines? Will the element grow, or is it a static size? Does the design need to adapt to mobile? The more flexible the size of your elements, the more difficult it may be to craft physical media to support them.\r\n\r\nWhen designing cards for the guestbook, I decided to design around a consistent 4:3 aspect ratio. For this, you can use `aspect-ratio` in CSS, which has coverage in [94% of browsers used globally](https://caniuse.com/?search=aspect-ratio).\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.notecard {\r\n  aspect-ratio: 4 / 3;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnforcing a static aspect ratio means we need to be thoughtful about how much text a user can enter. How wide is each line of text? How many total characters can the content area support?\r\n\r\nWe can use the `ch` unit in CSS to define the maximum width of the text. The `ch` unit is equal to the width of the character `0` in the selected font, and since we're using a monospace font where all characters are the same width, we can use `ch` to display exactly 28 characters per line.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.notecard .content {\r\n  width: 28ch;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe want to allow users to draw ASCII art and other fun things, too. To do that, we need to preserve whitespace for entries and prevent long lines of unbroken text from overflowing the container.\r\n\r\n```scss ins={3-4}\r\n.notecard .content {\r\n  width: 28ch;\r\n  white-space: pre-wrap; // Preserve whitespace\r\n  overflow-wrap: break-word; // Break long lines of text\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can enforce these limits in our HTML for form submission:\r\n\r\n```html {5-7}\r\n\u003Ctextarea\r\n  name=\"content\"\r\n  placeholder=\"Leave a message, write a poem, draw some ASCII art...\"\r\n  required\r\n  rows=\"5\"\r\n  cols=\"28\"\r\n  maxlength=\"140\"\r\n>\u003C/textarea>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can also tell the form to preserve implicit newlines on submission with `wrap=\"hard\"`, which will guarantee that even if we change our CSS in the future or decide to display guestbook entries somewhere else, handcrafted ASCII art will remain intact.\r\n\r\n```html ins={8}\r\n\u003Ctextarea\r\n  name=\"content\"\r\n  placeholder=\"Leave a message, write a poem, draw some ASCII art...\"\r\n  required\r\n  rows=\"5\"\r\n  cols=\"28\"\r\n  maxlength=\"140\"\r\n  wrap=\"hard\"\r\n>\u003C/textarea>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are a few other details to take care of, like showing a warning message when there's no room left for text, but the above code takes care of the basic setup for a fixed-size, fixed-length textarea.\r\n\r\n### Use a flatbed scanner\r\n\r\nDedicated scanners are cheap nowadays, and produce better results than photography. There are two types of scanners: CIS scanners have a very shallow focus, while CCD scanners have a [wider depth of field](http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artjan13/dw-scanner-type.html). (I used a $60 [CIS scanner](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-Lide-Slim-Scanner/dp/B07G5YBS1W?th=1) for this project, but if I needed to buy a new scanner today it would be a CCD!)\r\n\r\nI've found that 300 DPI is enough resolution for retina displays. Through trial and error, I also learned that putting a contrasting backdrop behind your documents will make it much easier to isolate the subject in tools like Photoshop after scanning.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure class=\"no-bleed\">\r\n\r\n![](./magic-wand.png)\r\n\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **Use a dark backdrop.** A contrasting backdrop makes documents easier to isolate using tools like the magic wand.\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\n### Be mindful of color contrast and file size\r\n\r\nImage backgrounds make it more difficult to measure [accessible color contrast](https://contrast.tools/) ratios for text on top; don't make any backgrounds too high-contrast. If you realize a shade you used was too dark, you can adjust contrast settings after scanning your images in. If there are any busy elements in your object, try to position them in a spot where text is unlikely to overlap. For the guestbook, I put the loudest elements in the margins, away from text.\r\n\r\nThe downside to working with images can be increased bandwidth. Use a command line tool like [optipng](https://optipng.sourceforge.net/) to losslessly compress files, or a build tool like Astro's [`\u003CImage />`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#image--astroassets) to handle it for you. There's no use in designing beautiful objects if a massive file size will prevent them from ever being seen!\r\n\r\n### Incorporate some randomness\r\n\r\nThe real world isn't often aligned in perfect 90 degree angles; your interface doesn't have to align to the grid, either. Consider incorporating some variation in how you position elements, for example, by using Astro's [`define:vars`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#definevars) style directive to pass variables into CSS:\r\n\r\n```astro\r\n---\r\n// Rotate each notecard randomly between 3 and -3 degrees\r\nconst randomRotation = `${Math.random() * 6 - 3}deg`;\r\n\r\n// Offset each notecard randomly between 12 and -12 pixels\r\nconst randomTranslateX = `${Math.random() * 24 - 12}px`;\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u003Cdiv class=\"notecard\">\r\n  \u003C!-- Notecard contents -->\r\n\u003C/div>\r\n\r\n\u003Cstyle define:vars={{ rotation: randomRotation, translateX: randomTranslateX }}>\r\n  .notecard {\r\n    transform: translateX(var(--translateX)) rotate(var(--rotation));\r\n  }\r\n\u003C/style>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Have fun!\r\n\r\nEmbrace experimentation and the freedom of designing without a screen. There are so many potential areas to bring physical objects into digital experiences. It isn't always called for or necessary, but for the right moment, a touch of real, physical texture can go a long way toward making an experience that's a joy to use.\r\n\r\nNow go off and draw your own UI.

Early in the book, Paul gushes about his love of gender-swapped covers:\r\n\r\n> Some covers deliver the age-old simple pleasures of drag—knowledge, the opportunity to investigate the simulacra and make comparisons, that obscure little frisson of dissonance. Take Joan Baez singing “Virgil Kane is my name… like my father before me, I’m a working man” (which, of course, is originally from The Band’s “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down)” or Cait O’Riordan from the Pogues crooning, “My name is Jock Stewart, I’m a canny gun man” (from the traditional “I’m a Man You Don’t Meet Every Day”). Joan Baez’s contralto can, if you squint your ears, pass as a farm-boy tenor; Cait O’Riordan’s chalky delivery might be that of a rich ponce.\r\n\r\nI listened to each cover and original, enamored with how lyrics could completely transform under another artist's tone, tempo, and gender.\r\n\r\nI began compiling Paul's songs into a playlist, and then I added more of my own. And more. And more. For another two years.\r\n\r\n## The Challenge\r\n\r\nAs my covers playlist grew, so did the tedium of managing it in Spotify. I kept all covers alphabetized (by hand), and I maintained two separate playlists—one for both [covers and originals](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5YQ4AyxQ6DeDxKJgSryAU2?si=68e701a76c854e5c), and another for [covers only](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/50iUGmY3cSUETCHGfUgf6a?si=f078e27420334399).\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"video-wrapper\">\r\n    \u003Cvideo\r\n      autoplay\r\n      loop\r\n      muted\r\n      playsinline\r\n      preload=\"none\"\r\n      poster=\"/video/adding-spotify-poster.png\"\r\n    >\r\n      \u003Csource src=\"/video/adding-spotify.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\r\n    \u003C/video>\r\n  \u003C/div>\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **Difficulties organizing in Spotify.** The interface makes it challenging\r\n    to organize songs within large playlists. (Sorting by title exists, but it's\r\n    unreliable here—John Denver's \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" deserves to live\r\n    beside Judy Collins's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane/Take Me Home Country Roads\".)\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nAfter managing this playlist for two years, I decided to build a custom solution to host and catalogue covers. I named it [Genderswap.fm](https://genderswap.fm/).\r\n\r\n## Laying Foundations\r\n\r\nThis personal project was my first time working directly on the backend. Thankfully, [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)—an open source alternative to Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)—made it easy to get started.\r\n\r\nI experimented with alternative data structures and landed on a two table model: one table for `songs`, and one table for `covers`, which links two `song` rows together along with extra metadata about their relation.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure class=\"no-bleed\" style=\"max-width: 600px\">\r\n  ![A visualization of the database schema for\r\n  Genderswap.fm.](./schema.png)(quality:100)\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **Database schema.** This is the shape of the data for Genderswap.fm.\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nI decided to use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) for my application framework. I had previously used Svelte in my build for the [NYC Boundaries Map](/projects/boundaries-map), and the addition of SvelteKit made it easy to manage routing, server-side rendering, and API requests. I set up a Spotify Developer account and used the [Spotify Web API TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/spotify/spotify-web-api-ts-sdk) to make it easy for users to search for and enter songs. I also added [Melt UI](https://melt-ui.com/), a Svelte-based component library, to help build the submission form.\r\n\r\n## Ideation\r\n\r\nFor the design, I knew I wanted to allow users to browse by pairs of songs shown together. It wouldn't be too different from browsing \"by album\" in any other music tool, but rather than displaying a single album for each result, I'd display original/cover pairs.\r\n\r\nFrom there, users could tap in to view the details of a cover, and listen to the original and the cover side-by-side, with notes about their differences.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"two-up\">\r\n    ![Detail page and form field sketches.](./sketch-1.png)\r\n\r\n    ![Search and filtering sketches.](./sketch-2.png)(quality:100)\r\n\r\n  \u003C/div>\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **Exploratory sketches.** Ideating around the display of albums, how to structure the submission form, and how to surface filters. I still hadn't figured out what I would ask users to tag manually, and what I could tag automatically using Spotify's API.\r\n  \u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\n## Finding a Design Language\r\n\r\nTo communicate the way these covers remix sound, reinterpret lyrics, and reconfigure meaning, I established a visual motif to thread its way through the app: two objects, overlapping and askew. Sharing space, but different.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n  ![A grid of albums and covers displayed on\r\n  Genderswap.fm](./album-grid.png)(quality:100)\r\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\r\n    **Overlapping visual motif.** Intentional overlapping groups the original\r\n    and cover as a single unit.

I'd also like [better search](https://github.com/evadecker/genderswap.fm/issues/133), and a way to [automatically generate and sync the Genderswap.fm database to a Spotify playlist](https://github.com/evadecker/genderswap.fm/issues/16). I track [all issues and ideas on GitHub](https://github.com/evadecker/genderswap.fm/issues), and contributions are welcome.\r\n\r\nI learned a lot building this out. The backend is not as scary as it seems, and I taught myself that it's possible for me to build a full-stack app from start to finish! There's still more to learn, and I hope to continue working on this project when I have time.","src/content/posts/genderswap/index.mdx",[515],"./genderswap-fm.png","90929ce056f43643","pages",["Map",519,520,532,533],"about",{"id":519,"data":521,"body":527,"filePath":528,"assetImports":529,"digest":531,"deferredRender":453},{"title":522,"description":523,"datePublished":524,"dateModified":525,"ogImage":526},"About Eva","Pushing pixels (non-derogatory).",["Date","2023-10-03T05:03:55.000Z"],["Date","2024-08-11T15:21:14.000Z"],"__ASTRO_IMAGE_./img1200.webp","import BadgeBanner from \"../../../components/BadgeBanner.astro\";\r\n\r\nI began coding in the late 2000s, typing into a textarea of vBulletin for a Nintendo fan forum. Without syntax highlighting, `border-radius`, or `flexbox`, I'd spend hours exporting assets from Photoshop and laying out content in CSS.\r\n\r\nType a few characters, and suddenly every `button` changes colors on hover. (From blue to... a slightly different blue!) I thought this was the coolest thing in the world.\r\n\r\nI still think coding is cool.\r\n\r\nMost of my job titles have included the word \"designer\", but code is my medium and the browser is my favorite design tool. I believe that designing for the web means working _in the medium_ of the web—namely, HTML and CSS. Interactive mediums deserve interactive iteration.\r\n\r\nI love working digitally, but when I need to think about gnarly problems, I take my sketchbook and my pen, I find a quiet place to sit, and I write.\r\n\r\nI currently work at [Scribe](https://scribehow.com) as a Senior Design Engineer. Previously, I spent time building things at [Cityblock](https://cityblock.com), [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com), and [Swiftype](https://swiftype.com). You can [download my resume here](/downloads/eva-decker-resume.pdf).\r\n\r\nIn my free time I play piano and listen to city pop and noodle with synths. I like [reading](https://hardcover.app/@evadecker) about urbanism, transit, and queer history, and I tend to a small but growing apartment balcony garden.\r\n\r\nAlways open to chats and coffee in NYC.

It's a home to share things I'm exploring and things I've built. It's a place for me to learn in public.\r\n\r\nAll code is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/evadecker/eva.town). The first commit was December 5, 2018, but the earliest version of this site dates back to 2015, an era when I eschewed versioning and uploaded files manually via \u003Cabbr title=\"File Transfer Protocol\">FTP\u003C/abbr>. I've grown a lot since then—and the technology around me has grown, too.\r\n\r\n## Technology\r\n\r\nThis site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build). Astro handles the content-heavy views (written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com)), but for more interactive components I use [React](https://react.dev) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). [Guestbook](/guestbook) entries are stored on [Turso](https://turso.tech/).\r\n\r\nCode is edited using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) on a [MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/). My terminal of choice is [Warp](https://www.warp.dev).\r\n\r\nEnd-to-end tests are written using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev), and I use [Polypane](https://polypane.app) to preview devices, test accessibility, and toggle user preferences like `prefers-reduced-motion`.\r\n\r\nDomain registration, hosting, and deployment are via [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). Email forwarding is through [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com). I send occasional [newsletters](https://buttondown.email/notesfromeva) using [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email).\r\n\r\nI shared more about the hardware I use on [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/interviews/eva.decker/).\r\n\r\n## Typography\r\n\r\nText is set in [HEX Franklin Variable](https://hex.xyz/HEX_Franklin/) with code in [`MonoLisa`](https://www.monolisa.dev/). Typography is scaled using a lot of math and a [fluid type scale](https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-with-fluid-type-scales) by [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/), meaning that font sizes will interpolate between mobile and desktop to optimize for the current browser width.\r\n\r\nType inspiration can be found anywhere, from comic art and video games to [bodega window displays](https://www.are.na/eva-decker/nyc-bodega-art), but I often return to a handful of resources:\r\n\r\n- [_The Elements of Typographic Style_](https://bookshop.org/a/97627/9780881792126) by Robert Bringhurst\r\n- [Butterick’s Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com)\r\n- Bethany Heck’s [Font Review Journal](https://fontreviewjournal.com)\r\n- [Fonts In Use](https://fontsinuse.com)\r\n\r\n## Styling\r\n\r\nI use [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) to apply palettes consistently, ensure accessibility, and seamlessly switch between light and dark mode. Icons are from [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com). Styles are written using plain 'ol CSS. Pixel portraits of me were created by [@NullTheFool](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@NullTheFool) on the [Pixel Art Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pixelart). Pixelated header images are created using the Atkinson dithering algorithm via [Dithermark](https://app.dithermark.com).\r\n\r\n## Sounds\r\n\r\nThe toy synth uses samples from [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/), [Bolder Sounds](https://www.boldersounds.com/index.php?main_page=product_music_info&products_id=71), [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/Samulis/packs/21029/), [Soundpacks](https://soundpacks.com/free-sound-packs/xylophone-samples-pack/), [Philharmonia Orchestra Sound Samples](https://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/sound_samples/banjo), [Precisionsound](https://store.precisionsound.net/shop/peruvian-ocarina/), [HearthSounds](https://github.com/mtimkovich/hearthsounds), and [The Mushroom Kingdom](https://themushroomkingdom.net/media/smw/wav).\r\n\r\n## Energy\r\n\r\nI minimize energy usage on this site by avoiding unnecessary scripts (such as trackers, analytics, or resource-intensive animations) and compressing images and video.\r\n\r\n> The internet consumes a lot of electricity. 416.2TWh per year to be precise.
